# Assignment5
Group project for intro to Java for Harley,Rilang and Marquis.

Just making a barebones depository for this and then going to bed.  Sort of assuming we're going to go about this in an object oriented way with each "word" being an instance of class word.  Then we use a public int to measure the frequency of each word.  If anyone wants to do it differently just tell me and stuff.
